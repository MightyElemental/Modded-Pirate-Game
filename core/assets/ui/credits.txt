Two steps ahead...

I am always two steps ahead...



This has been
the greatest 
social experiment
I've come to know.


Certainly the greatest social experiment
of my entire life.


It's alluring,

it's compelling,
it's gripping

to bear witness to observe

all these unwell,

unbalanced,

disoriented beings 
roam the internet 

in search of stories.


In search of.. ideas,

of conflict, 
of rivalries,

where people develop

a distinctive desire

for direct engagement 

where people feel involved
with the stories

and therefore become

product of influence.
